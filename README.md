ðŸ“ˆ Key Insights
1. Total Sales crossed â‚¹79M within just 3â€“4 months (Aprâ€“Jun 2022), showing strong volume for a short timeframe.

4. Shirts and Blazers contribute another 40%+ (â‚¹21M + â‚¹11M), meaning just 3 apparel categories make up ~90% of sales.
5. Categories like Perfumes, Wallets, Shoes, Socks, Watches are negligible â€“ under 5% combined, suggesting focus should remain on apparel.
